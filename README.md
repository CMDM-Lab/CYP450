## Abstract
We collected and organized a detailed dataset encompassing both substrates and non-substrates for six principal cytochrome
P450 (CYP450) isozymes, responsible for 90% of Phase I drug metabolism in humans. These isozymes, specifically CYP1A2,
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, play critical roles in the detoxification and metabolic processing of
therapeutic compounds. The dataset, meticulously assembled, includes interactions with approximately 2000 compounds per
enzyme, ensuring comprehensive coverage and high accuracy. Employing a combination of conventional machine learning
techniques alongside advanced methodologies such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), robust models have been
developed to elucidate these drug-enzyme interactions. The dataset is poised to significantly contribute to fields requiring
pharmacokinetic modeling, furthering drug development efforts and toxicological studies by providing an essential resource for
the accurate prediction of metabolic pathways, thereby enhancing drug safety and efficacy assessments.
